PRINTF FUNCTION PROJECT
This project was carried out by team of twos to understand the concept of team work and also, implementing the concept of printf() function

All Tasks Explained
These are all tasks performed on this project

Task 0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life]
Write a function that produces output according to format.
c : convs input into a character
s : convs input into a string
Task 1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't
Handle the following conversion specifiers:
d : convs input into a base 10 integer
i : convs input into an integer
Task 2. Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the gospel
Create a man page for your function
Task 3. With a face like mine, I do better in print
Handle the following conversion specifiers:
b : the unsigned int argument is conved to binary
Task 4. What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print
Handle the following conversion specifiers:
u : convs the input into an unsigned integer
o : convs the input into an octal number
x : convs the input into a hexadecimal number
X : convs the input into a hexadecimal number with capital letters
Task 5. Nothing in fine print is ever good news
Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.
Task 6. My weakness is wearing too much leopard print
Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
S : prints the string
Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters)
Task 7. How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journalists and believe these lies when they see them in print
Handle the following conversion specifier:
pt : int input is conved to a pointer address
Task 8. The big print gives and the small print takes away
Handle the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers:
+ : adds a + in front of signed positive numbers and a - in front of signed negative numbers
_space : same as +, but adds a _space (is overwritten by +)
# : adds a 0 in front of octal conversions that don't begin with one, and a 0x or 0X for x or X conversions
Task 9. Sarcasm is lost in print
Handle the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers:
l : convs d, i, u, o, x, X conversions in short signed or unsigned ints
h : convs d, i, u, o, x, X conversions in long signed or unsigned ints
Task 10. Print some money and give it to us for the rain forests
Handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Task 11. The negative is the equivalent of the composer's score, and the print the performance
Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Task 12. It's depressing when you're still around and your albums are out of print
Handle the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Task 13. Every time that I wanted to give up, if I saw an interesting textile, print what ever, suddenly I would see a collection]
Handle the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Task 14. Print is the sharpest and the strongest weapon of our party
Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
r : prints the reversed string
Task 15. The flood of print has turned reading into a process of gulping rather than savoring
Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
R : prints the rot13'ed string
Task 16.
All the above options work well together.
